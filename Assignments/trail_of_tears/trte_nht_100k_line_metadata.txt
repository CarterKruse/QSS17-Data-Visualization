      Title: Designated Route of the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail
      Online_Linkage: Default value.
  Description:
    Abstract: This is a vector line ESRI Shapefile showing the approximate designated route of the Trail of Tears national historic trail. The coordinates for this data set were generally heads-up digitized at a scale of 1:100,000 (or larger) off of a series of planning maps and DRGs using a variety of GIS software packages.
    Purpose: To show the location of the Designated Route of the Trail of Tears national historic trail. This data set represents a continuous representation of the trail as depicted in the Comprehensive Management Plan.  The NHT alignment was identified before ground-verification could occur and consequently the designated trail does not always coincide with historic trail trace. This trail is not accessible nor developed for the entire length depicted in this data set.  Do not cross private land without permission.  The intended use of all data in the trail GIS library is to support diverse trail activities including planning, management, maintenance, research, and interpretation.
    Supplemental_Information: This data set was prepared on 3/1/2017. Only data for TRTE NHT is included.

  Access_Constraints: See Use Constraints.
  Use_Constraints: The designated national historic trail is not a fully developed hiking trail, but is a congressionally designated line, similar to a political boundary, that crosses many ownership jurisdictions.  Do not cross private land without permission. This data set should not be displayed or used at scales that exceed 1:100,000.  This is not a legal survey product.  For Section 106 and other compliance reviews, it is incumbent on the project proponent to contact the local land manager, owner and State Historic Preservation Office for more detailed data on trail resources to use during analysis.
